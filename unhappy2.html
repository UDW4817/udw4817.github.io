Berries are considered one of the healthiest foods. There is nothing worse than letting stress get in your way, especially when you are feeling down. This can lead to an overwhelming spiral exhausting you mentally and physically. Blueberries can help prevent the release of cortisol, a hormone produced by the adrenal gland during stressful situations, that travels to the hippocampus (a major portion of your brain) and provides emotional responses. Berries can help control and counter the effects of this hormone and the impact on your mood.

Berries are loaded with anthocyanidins, known to boost brain function and antioxidants, which promote brain and nervous system health. Berries are also low in sugar and calories, so pile them on!</p>
