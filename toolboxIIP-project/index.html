							In the <strong>cyber security</strong> world, the person who is able to<strong> discover</strong> a <strong>weakness</strong> in the system and manages to <strong>exploit</strong> it to accomplish his or her’s goal <strong>(good</strong> or<strong> bad)</strong> is referred to as <strong>Hacker.</strong><br><br>

							<strong>Nowadays,</strong> People think that<stong> hacking</stong> is only<strong> hijacking Facebook</strong> accounts or defacing <strong>websites,</strong> yes it is also part of the hacking field but it doesn’t mean that it is <strong>all there is.</strong> This is not even the <strong>tip of the iceberg.</strong>

							So <strong>what is exactly</strong> hacking and what should you do to prevent it happening. <strong>This is what this site is for</strong>, the only thing you need to become a hacker is interest and <strong>dedication.</strong> You should always be ready to learn something <strong>new and learn </strong>to create <strong>something newer.</strong><br><br>


							<strong>Hacking</strong> is the practice of modifying the features of a system or <strong>finding a loophole,</strong> in order to accomplish a goal outside of the creators original purpose.

							Due to the mass attention given to the so called <strong>“BLACKHATS”</strong> or<strong> “CRACKERS”</strong> from the media, the reputation of all hackers,<strong> even the good ones</strong> is damaged. <strong>This is what this site is for </strong>- to turn this image around .
							hacking always viewed as something illegal and shrewd.This is almost never the case. <strong>A few bad guys doing a few bad things</strong> has put a bad name to the <strong>entire community.</strong> This doesn’t have to be so, which is why I’ve made this site.

							The goal of this site is to introduce to people the<strong> true philosophy and ethics </strong>of the elusive world of hacking, hopefully <strong>clearing their name </strong>and giving them the <strong>social status they deserve </strong>. I will show you everything this is to show about hacking. Every single hacking technique that exists, how it works and how to actually carry them out your self. You will get to know how to protect yourself from these same hacks.
