							<p><strong>ScriptKiddie</strong>
							Script kiddies, in a word are noobs.They are the people who use tools, scripts, methods and programs created by real hackers. They are the ones who don’t know how a system works but are still able to exploit it with previously available tools, not by walking the footsteps of actual hackers but simply copying what they did and using it for malicious purposes. A script kiddie is that one annoying kid in class who pisses everyone off don’t be that guy.

					        <h3>White Hat Hackers</h3>
					        <p><strong>White Hat Hackers</strong> or penetration testers are the good guys who hack for security purposes. although what they do is pretty much the same as the bad guys, but a world of difference arises when it comes to ethics.The main aim of a white hat hackers is to improve the security of a system by finding security flaws and fixing it before the bad guys find it and exploit it.They are usually officially employed by organisations and companies to protect their virtual assets from coming to harm.The may work also individually to make cyber space more secure.Kind of a voluntary worldwide community service. An example of this is the team behind the iinfamous Hacking Toll know as Metasploit who work tirelessly reporting new security flaws and their fixes in various softwares. 
                            The site only concentrates on WHITE HAT HACKING and helps you learn how to hack for the welfare of everyone.           </p>

					        <p><strong>Black Hat Hackers</strong> are our enemies.They are the bad guys, cyber criminals who have malicious intents.These are the hackers who steal money or valuable data, infect systems with viruses, trojans and male wear etc. These are the ones who’ve the world of hacking a bad reputation and it is up to us, the white hat to bring them down.They use their hacking skills for illegal purposes with unethical goals and some times just to watch the world burn.If ever you are attracted to the dark side of hacking, ask yourself this: “is a night of glory really worth a lifetime behind bars?
                            if a person can get half a dozen years sentence for copying images(fact), skye the limit when it comes to convicting cyber criminals.

					        <h3>Grey Hat Hackers</h3>
					       <p><strong>Grey Hat Hackers</strong>These are the hackers who may work offensively or defensively , depending on the situation.They belong to the neutral zone. Hackers who don’t have malicious intentions but still like to break into third-party systems just for the thrill and fn or maybe just to announce a newfound vulnerability in a wild and supposedly heroic way.
                            Nobody likes a show off and the GreyHats do just that. Breaking into virtual databases, say for example one containing creditcards information is just as illegal as actually stealing them.So even fooling around lie this can land you in jail.
