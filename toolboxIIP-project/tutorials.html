							Script kiddies, in a word are noobs.They are the people who use tools, scripts, methods and programs created by real hackers. They are the ones who don’t know how a system works but are still able to exploit it with previously available tools, not by walking the footsteps of actual hackers but simply copying what they did and using it for malicious purposes. A script kiddie is that one annoying kid in class who pisses everyone off don’t be that guy.<a href="http://resources.infosecinstitute.com/25-ways-to-become-the-ultimate-script-kiddie/">InfoSEC</a>

					        <p align="center"><strong>White Hat Hackers</strong> or penetration testers are the good guys who hack for security purposes. although what they do is pretty much the same as the bad guys, but a world of difference arises when it comes to ethics.The main aim of a white hat hackers is to improve the security of a system by finding security flaws and fixing it before the bad guys find it and exploit it.They are usually officially employed by organisations and companies to protect their virtual assets from coming to harm.The may work also individually to make cyber space more secure.Kind of a voluntary worldwide community service. An example of this is the team behind the iinfamous Hacking Toll know as Metasploit who work tirelessly reporting new security flaws and their fixes in various softwares.

					       <p align="center"><strong>Grey Hat Hackers</strong>These are the hackers who may work offensively or defensively , depending on the situation.They belong to the neutral zone. Hackers who don’t have malicious intentions but still like to break into third-party systems just for the thrill and fn or maybe just to announce a newfound vulnerability in a wild and supposedly heroic way.
                            Nobody likes a show off and the GreyHats do just that. Breaking into virtual databases, say for example one containing creditcards information is just as illegal as actually stealing them.So even fooling around lie this can land you in jail.<a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/04/hacker-lexicon-white-hat-gray-hat-black-hat-hackers/">Wired</a>

The term <strong>“Hacking”</strong>historically referred to constructive, cleaver technical work that was not necessarily related to computer systems.Todays , however, hacking and hackers are most commonly associated with malicious programming attacks on the internet and other networks.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker">Wiki</a> <br><br>

								 <p align="center"><strong>Origins</strong>of <strong>Hacking</strong>:
									M.I.T Engineers in the <strong>1950s</strong> and<strong> 1960s</strong> first popularised the term and concept of hacking.Started at the model train club and later in the mainframe computer rooms, the so-called”hack” perpetrated by these hackers were intended to be <strong>harmless</strong>technical experiments and fun learning activities . Later, outside of <strong>M.I.T</strong> others began applying the term to less honourable pursuits.Before the internet became popular, for example, several hackers in the U.S experimented with methods to modify telephones for making long-distance calls over the phone network illegally.As computer network and the internet exploded in popularity, data networks became by far the most common target of hackers and hacking         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_computer_security_hacker_history">Origins</a>

							     <p align="center"><strong>Common Network Hacking Techniques</strong>
                                  Hacking on computer networks is often done through scripts or other network programming. These programs generally manipulate data passing through a network connection in ways designed to obtain more information about how the target system works.Many such pre-packaged scripts are posted soon the internet for anyone,typically eatery-level hackers, to use.More advanced hackers may study and modify these scripts to develop new methods. A few highly skilled hackers work for commercial firms with jobs to protect that company’s software and data from outside hacking.Cracking techniques on networks include creating worms, initiating denial of service<strong>(D.O.S) attacks, or in establishing unauthorised remote access connections to a device.<a href="http://www.mydigitalshield.com/5-ways-hackers-gain-access-data/">MyDigitalShield</a> <br><br>
